## * Accept four (4) command line arguments corresponding to two states / state capitals (initial and goal states) so your code could be executed with
### * python .py FILENAME ALGO P1 P2

## * where:
### * FILENAME is the input CSV file name (graph G data),
### * ALGO is mode in which your program should operate
#### * 1 – Simulated Annealing,
#### * 2 – Genetic Algorithm,

### * P1 is a value for a specific algorithm parameter:
#### * Simulated Annealing: P1 is the initial temperature T value,
#### * Genetic Algorithm: P1 is the number of iterations K,

### * P2 is a value for a specific algorithm parameter:
#### * Simulated Annealing: P2 is the  parameter for the temperature cooling schedule,
#### * Genetic Algorithm: P2 is the mutation probability Pm value,
